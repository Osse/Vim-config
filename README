Install it like this:

    cd
    git clone git://github.com/Osse/Vim-config.git .vim
    curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim

The configuration files .vimrc and .gvimrc are located inside the .vim
directory to making using the repo easier. On Windows, run this:

    for i in {,g}vimrc; do
        echo 'source $HOME/.vim/'"$i" > "$HOME/.$i"
    done
    Â¨
since $HOME/.vim is not in Vim's runetimepath by default.

Run :PlugInstall from within Vim. This makes Plug automatically
install all the plugins listed in vimrc with the :Plug command.
