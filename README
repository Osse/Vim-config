The configuration files .vimrc and .gvimrc are located inside the .vim directory to making using the repo easier. To use them as your regular config files for Vim, set up links to them like this:

$ cd ~
$ ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrgc
$ ln -s .vim/gvimrc .gvimrc

Next, install Vundle:

$ git://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git ~/.vim/bundle/vundle

After that, run :BundleInstall from within Vim. This makes Vundle automatically install all the plugins listed in vimrc as 'bundles.' (Note to self: perhaps make Vundle itself a submodule?)
